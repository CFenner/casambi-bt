# A bluetooth based Python library for controlling Casambi networks

This library provides a currently **alpha quality** interface to Casambi-based lights over Bluetooth.
The author is not associated with Casambi and the implementation is based on his own analysis of the protocol.
This interface is not feature complete and was only tested with a very small network.

For a more mature solution using a gateway and the official Casambi API have a look at [https://github.com/hellqvio86/aiocasambi](https://github.com/hellqvio86/aiocasambi).

## Getting started

This library is available on PyPi:
```
pip install casambi-bt
```
Have a look at `demo.py` for a small example.
